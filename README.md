# cyf-simple-tests

Starter repo for writing Jest tests

# Getting started

As usual, fork, clone, and run `npm install`

# Running tests

To run all tests, run `npm test`

# Writing tests

Write your code inside `Foo.js` and write your tests inside `Foo.test.js`. See `MovieList.js` and `MovieList.test.js` to get you started.

Note that this repo does not come with react or babel, or any nice setup, so you will have to use CommonJS modules (using `module.exports` and `require`), rather than ES modules (with `import` and `export`),
